## Instructions/How to Run:
1. Open terminal/cmd shell
2. Navigate to root directory of this Project
3. Run the following command:
```bash
 java -jar out/artifacts/Assembler_jar/Assembler.jar \
      test/SourceProgramReader/AllCommands.txt
```

## Expected Output:
Output files will be stored in this directory:
```
```
These are the expected output files:
- 




## Debugging/Issues:
*Note - if step 3 does not work, may need modify the directories:
```bash
java -jar directory/of/artifacts/with/Assembler.jar \
          directory/of/test/codeToAssemble.txt
```


## Additional Info:
We have two programs to run on our assembler:
1. ExampleProgram.txt
   Example code copied from project spec
```bash
 java -jar out/artifacts/Assembler_jar/Assembler.jar \
      test/SourceProgramReader/ExampleProgram.txt
```
   
2. AllCommands.txt
   Example code for assembling every instruction type
```bash
 java -jar out/artifacts/Assembler_jar/Assembler.jar \
      test/SourceProgramReader/AllCommands.txt
```

To run alternative programs, simply alter the file names. 
All programs will be stored in this directory.
